 PHP functionality added to datatables library for quick quiz filtering 

## A second-level heading
This contains to different ways to achieve the same functionality: quick filtering through tens of thousands of rows from a wordpress based quiz page.

One does a single call to the DB and then processes it on the client-side, the other makes a single call to the DB when loaded and keeps calling the DB for each re-draw of the page (filtering, sorting, paging...)

I'm uploading these for personal reference and future use
